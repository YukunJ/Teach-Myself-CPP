### Guideline31: Use External Polymorphism for Nonintrusive Runtime Polymorphism
+ Apply the External Polymorphism design pattern with the intent to enable the polymorphic treatment of nonpolymorphic types.
+ Consider the External Polymorphism design pattern as a key player to achieve loose coupling.
+ Exploit the design flexibilities of the externalized inheritance hierarchy.
+ Understand the differences between External Polymorphism and Adapter.
+ Prefer nonintrusive solutions to intrusive solutions.

### Guideline2: Design for Change
+ Expect change in software.
+ Design for easy change and make software more adaptable.
+ Avoid combining unrelated, orthogonal aspects to prevent coupling.
+ Understand that coupling increase the likelihood for change and makes change harder.
+ Adhere to the Single-Responsibility-Principle (SRP) to separate concerns.
+ Follow the Don't-Repeat-Yourself (DRY) principle to minimize duplication.
+ Avoid premature abstraction if you are not sure about the next change.

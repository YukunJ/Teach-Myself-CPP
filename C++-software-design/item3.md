### Guideline3: Separate Interfaces to Avoid Artificial Coupling
+ Be aware that coupling also affects interfaces.
+ Adhere to the Interface-Segregation-Principle (ISP) to separate concerns in interfaces.
+ Consider the ISP as a special case of the Single-Responsibility-Principle (SRP).
+ Understand that the ISP helps for both inheritance hierarchies and templates.

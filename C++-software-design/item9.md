### Guideline9: Pay Attention to the Ownership of Abstractions
+ Keep in mind that in a proper architecture, low-level implementation details depend on high-level abstractions.
+ Adhere to the Dependency-Inversion-Principle (DIP), and assign abstractions to the high level  of an architecture.
+ Make sure abstractions are owned by the high level, not by the low level.

### Guideline5: Design for Extension
+ Favor design that makes it easy to extend code.
+ Adhere to the Open-Closed-Principle (OCP) to keep code open for extension but closed for modification.
+ Design for code additions by means of base classes, templates, function overloading or template specialization.
+ Avoid premature abstraction if you are not sure about the next addition.

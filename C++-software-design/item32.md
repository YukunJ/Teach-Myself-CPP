### Guideline32: Consider Replacing Inheritance Hierarchies with Type Erasure
+ Apply the Type Erasure design pattern with the intent to provide a value-based, nonintrusive abstraction for an extendable set of unrelated, potentially nonpolymorphic types with the same semantic behavior.
+ Consider Type Erasure as a compound design pattern, built from the External Polymorphism, Bridge and Prototype design patterns.
+ Understand the advantage of Type Erasure, but also keep in mind its limitations.
+ Use the term Type Erasure only to communicate its intent as a design pattern that allows easy addition of types supporting a fixed set of operations.

# Teach-Myself-CPP

Hey! Welcome to this repository. This is the notes-keeping place for teaching myself C++, modern C++ in specific. It might also include some auxiliary topics about useful tools.

I learned traditional C++98 a few years ago and didn't quite work on this programming language recently. In order to better prepare myself for workplace once I graduate from school, I will teach myself modern C++ in leisure time and update notes here. Hopefully, this notes could also help other people wishing to get onboard with modern C++.
